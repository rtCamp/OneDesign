Synchronize block patterns across multiple WordPress sites. Create once, deploy anywhere with centralized pattern management for enterprise teams.

== Description ==

OneDesign is a powerful pattern synchronization solution designed for enterprises managing multiple WordPress sites or multisite networks. It enables you to define block patterns on a Governing site and distribute them to brand sites, maintaining design consistency across your entire network.

**Why OneDesign?**

Managing multiple websites—whether for different brands, regions, or languages shouldn't mean reinventing the wheel each time. Instead of designing layouts from scratch for each site, OneDesign lets you create once and deploy anywhere, in just one click.

Built for enterprise teams, OneDesign unifies your design, editorial, and development processes across all web properties. The result? A shared design system that dramatically cuts down on development, decision-making, and opportunity costs—saving you hundreds of thousands of dollars.

**Key Benefits:**

* **50% Time Savings:** Eliminate redundant pattern creation across multiple sites
* **Brand Integrity Guardian:** Prevent design drift and maintain consistent branding
* **Cost Reduction:** Reduce operational costs through centralized pattern management
* **Design Governance:** Control which patterns can be used across sites
* **Scalable Growth:** Connect unlimited sites without multisite limitations

**Core Features:**

* **Secure API Integration:** REST API with unique authentication keys for safe pattern transfer
* **Intuitive Pattern Browser:** Full-screen admin interface with search and filtering functionality
* **Batch Operations:** Deploy multiple patterns across multiple sites simultaneously
* **Pattern Status Monitoring:** Track deployment success and synchronization across connected sites
* **Pattern Management:** View, apply, and remove patterns from the centralized dashboard
